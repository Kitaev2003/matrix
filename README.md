# Matrix #
## What do matrix? ##
If you only need calculate the determinant or rang. You can  quickly change ***main.cpp***. Also "Matrix" can do simple arithmetic operations, for example: multiply, subtraction, addition and operators. For output or input you can ```<<``` or ```>>```.   I made Unit Test in the "matrix". You can view  file for testing in the folder ***Test***. I think, that all people don`t use this function. 
## How use matrix? ##
I work with help MakeFile, so you can use ready-made commands. 
##### Start main.cpp #####
```make```
##### Start UnitTest #####
``` make testing ```
##### Running an executable file #####
```make begin```
